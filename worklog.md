Agent: Main
Task: Full feature audit and bug fix pass across all components

Work Log:
- Read and audited all 8 key files: page.tsx, ai-gallery-section.tsx, watch-now-popup.tsx, ad-components.tsx, ad-scripts-provider.tsx, use-ad-monetization.ts, layout.tsx, globals.css
- Ran ESLint — initially clean, found issues during code review
- Checked dev server log — no new errors after fixes

Bugs found and fixed:

1. **page.tsx — Dead code / unused imports**
   - Removed unused `SidebarAd` import (no sidebar ads in current layout)
   - Removed dead `stats` constant (hero stats section was removed in prior task)
   - Cleaned up extra blank lines left from stats removal

2. **watch-now-popup.tsx — 4 unused imports**
   - Removed `Volume2`, `Maximize2`, `Settings`, `SkipForward` (imported but never used)

3. **watch-now-popup.tsx — Missing `group` class (CSS hover bug)**
   - Line 398 (was 397): Video player container had `group-hover:opacity-100` on child element (bottom controls bar) but no `group` class on parent
   - Fixed by adding `group` class to the video player div
   - Result: Bottom controls bar now properly shows/hides on hover

4. **ad-components.tsx — Random ad text changing on every re-render**
   - `getRandomCopy()` was called directly in render body → ad text shuffled on every state change
   - Fixed by wrapping in `useMemo()` with `size` dependency
   - Also memoized `copyType` computation

5. **ad-components.tsx — Inconsistent ad URL between href and click handler**
   - `href` attribute called `getRandomSmartlink()` directly → changed on every render
   - Click handler used a separate `getRandomSmartlink()` call → different URL than href
   - Fixed by creating `adUrl` with `useMemo()` and using it for both `href` and `handleClick`

6. **ad-components.tsx — React hooks called after conditional return**
   - After adding `useMemo` calls, they ended up after `if (dismissed) return null;`
   - This violated React's rules-of-hooks (hooks must be called unconditionally)
   - Fixed by moving all `useMemo` calls before the conditional return

All fixes verified:
- ESLint passes with 0 errors, 0 warnings
- Dev server compiles successfully
- Page returns HTTP 200

Stage Summary:
- 6 bugs found and fixed across 3 files
- All lint checks pass
- No runtime errors in dev log
- Ad system now stable: consistent URLs and copy per slot render
- Popup video player controls bar hover effect now works correctly
- No dead code or unused imports remaining

Task: Build admin backend for managing gallery card images and text

Work Log:
- Updated prisma/schema.prisma: Added GalleryCard model (id, sceneId, title, tag, image, duration, views, icon, category, order, active, timestamps)
- Ran db:push to sync schema, generated Prisma client
- Created prisma/seed.ts: Seeded all 28 existing gallery cards into database
- Created API routes:
  - GET /api/gallery — public endpoint, returns active cards ordered by order
  - GET/POST /api/admin/cards — admin CRUD (list all + create)
  - PUT/DELETE /api/admin/cards/[id] — admin update/delete
  - POST /api/admin/upload — image upload (validates type/size, saves to public/ai-gallery/, optionally links to card)
- Created /admin page (src/app/admin/page.tsx):
  - Stats bar (total/active/inactive/categories counts)
  - Search + category filter + show inactive toggle
  - Card grid with hover actions (edit/image/visibility/delete)
  - Edit dialog with 3 tabs: Details (title/tag/category/duration/views/icon), Image (preview + URL + file upload), Settings (order/active toggle)
  - Quick image upload dialog for fast slot image replacement
  - Delete confirmation dialog
  - Sticky footer with card count summary
  - "View Site" button to return to main page
- Updated src/components/ai-gallery-section.tsx:
  - Removed hardcoded GALLERY_CARDS array (28 entries)
  - Now fetches cards from /api/gallery via useEffect
  - Icon mapping from string names to Lucide components via ICON_MAP
  - Loading state with spinner while fetching
  - All other rendering logic (filter, pagination, animations) preserved
- Verified: lint clean (0 errors), dev server compiling, API returning 200 with data

Stage Summary:
- Full admin backend: database-driven gallery card management
- Admin panel at /admin with CRUD, image upload, search/filter, toggle active
- Gallery now reads from database instead of hardcoded array — changes in admin reflect instantly
- Image upload saves to /public/ai-gallery/ and auto-links to card
- Key files: prisma/schema.prisma, prisma/seed.ts, src/app/api/gallery/route.ts, src/app/api/admin/cards/route.ts, src/app/api/admin/cards/[id]/route.ts, src/app/api/admin/upload/route.ts, src/app/admin/page.tsx, src/components/ai-gallery-section.tsx

Agent: Main Agent
Task: Full feature audit — fix popup card mismatch, broken upload, and clean up

Work Log:
- Audited all key files: page.tsx, ai-gallery-section.tsx, watch-now-popup.tsx, admin API routes
- Tested all API endpoints: /api/gallery (200), /api/admin/cards (200), /api/admin/upload (broken)
- Identified 4 bugs and fixed them all

Bugs found and fixed:

1. **CRITICAL: "Watch Now" buttons pass MouseEvent to openPopup (page.tsx)**
   - All 3 "Watch Now" buttons (nav, hero, final CTA) used `onClick={openPopup}` directly
   - This passed the React MouseEvent object as the card parameter
   - The popup received `selectedCard = MouseEvent`, then crashed trying to call `.sceneId.replace()` on undefined
   - Fixed by changing all 3 to `onClick={() => openPopup()}` — now passes `undefined` which becomes `null`
   - Also made `openPopup` accept optional parameter: `card?: {...} | null`

2. **CRITICAL: Popup shows wrong card when selectedCard is not a valid card object (watch-now-popup.tsx)**
   - FEATURED useMemo checked `if (selectedCard)` but a MouseEvent is truthy, causing it to try accessing non-existent properties
   - Added type safety: `typeof selectedCard === "object" && "sceneId" in selectedCard && "title" in selectedCard`
   - Added null-safe fallbacks for all selectedCard property accesses (`.sceneId || ""`, `.image || "/ai-gallery/scene-01.png"`)

3. **CRITICAL: Upload API route missing (/api/admin/upload)**
   - Admin page calls `POST /api/admin/upload` but the route file was lost from a previous session
   - Created `src/app/api/admin/upload/route.ts`:
     - Validates multipart/form-data content type (returns 400 if wrong)
     - Validates file type (JPG, PNG, WebP, GIF only)
     - Validates file size (5MB max)
     - If cardId provided: saves as stable `scene-XX.ext` filename, deletes old format files, updates DB
     - If no cardId: saves with unique timestamp-based filename
   - Tested successfully: upload with cardId correctly renames file and updates database

4. **Duplicate image files in public/ai-gallery/**
   - 53 files for 28 scenes (some had both original .png and uploaded .webp/.jpg)
   - Identified which format each scene uses from database
   - Deleted 25 old .png files that were no longer referenced
   - Reduced from 53 to 28 files (1 per scene)
   - Regenerated scene-01.webp after accidental deletion during testing

All fixes verified:
- ESLint passes with 0 errors
- Dev server compiles with no runtime errors
- Gallery API returns 28 active cards with valid image paths
- Admin cards API returns 28 cards
- Upload API works with multipart/form-data
- All "Watch Now" buttons properly pass null instead of MouseEvent
- Popup FEATURED useMemo has type-safe card validation

Stage Summary:
- Fixed 4 bugs: MouseEvent leak, popup type safety, missing upload route, duplicate files
- All features working: gallery display, card click → popup with correct card, admin CRUD, image upload
- 28 gallery images, 28 database cards, all active, proper categories
- Key files: src/app/page.tsx, src/components/watch-now-popup.tsx, src/app/api/admin/upload/route.ts (new)

Task: Fix Vercel deployment — add static data fallback for no-database environments

Work Log:
- Diagnosed: SQLite does NOT work on Vercel serverless (read-only filesystem, no persistent storage)
- All API routes fail on Vercel → gallery empty, admin empty, popup broken

Solution: Dual-mode architecture (DB + Static Fallback)

1. Created `src/lib/gallery-data.ts` — Static data module with all 28 cards
   - Exports `getStaticCards(activeOnly)` and `getStaticCardsAll()` functions
   - Contains all 28 card definitions matching current database state
   - Works everywhere — no database, no API, no filesystem needed

2. Updated API routes to fallback gracefully:
   - `/api/gallery/route.ts`: Try DB first → fallback to static data
   - `/api/admin/cards/route.ts`: GET tries DB → fallback to static; POST/PUT/DELETE return 503 with message
   - `/api/admin/cards/[id]/route.ts`: PUT/DELETE return 503 if DB unavailable
   - All routes use dynamic `import("@/lib/db")` so they don't crash when Prisma isn't configured

3. Updated `src/components/ai-gallery-section.tsx`:
   - Fetch from API first, if fails → use `getStaticCards(true)` directly
   - Cards always render even without database

4. Updated `src/components/watch-now-popup.tsx`:
   - Fetch from API first, if fails → use `getStaticCards(true)` for related content
   - Popup always works with correct card data

5. Updated `src/app/admin/page.tsx`:
   - Fetch from API, if fails → use `getStaticCardsAll()` as fallback
   - Shows amber "Read-Only Mode" banner when database unavailable
   - Cards still display with all info; edit/delete show it needs local deployment

All verified:
- ESLint: 0 errors
- Dev server: no runtime errors
- Gallery API: 28 cards (DB)
- Admin API: 28 cards (DB)
- Static fallback tested independently: 28 cards, correct data
- Home page: 200 OK

Stage Summary:
- Site now works on Vercel without any database
- Locally: full DB-powered admin with CRUD + upload
- On Vercel: static fallback data, read-only admin view
- Gallery always shows 28 cards with correct images, categories, titles
- Popup always shows correct card when clicked
- Key files: src/lib/gallery-data.ts (new), src/app/api/gallery/route.ts, src/app/api/admin/cards/route.ts, src/app/api/admin/cards/[id]/route.ts, src/components/ai-gallery-section.tsx, src/components/watch-now-popup.tsx, src/app/admin/page.tsx
