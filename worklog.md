Task: Add ad placement system to the landing page

Work Log:
- Created reusable ad component system in src/components/ad-components.tsx:

  - MobileStickyAd: 320x50 sticky bottom bar, mobile-only, dismissible with safe-area-inset support
- Integrated 8 ad placements into page.tsx at strategic positions:

  2. Between Features & How It Works (leaderboard)
  3. Before Article (leaderboard) — above long-content engagement zone
  4. In-Article Midway (native) — within SEO content, between H3 sections
  5. In-Article Lower (native) — second in-content placement
